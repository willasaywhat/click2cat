# Click2Cat: Because sometimes an ASC isn't what you need.

This is a simple Chrome addon that adds functionality to the Veracode platform. It adds a button next to "Request Consultation" in the platform called "Click2Cat". 

Really. That's all it does.

## To Install

* Download click2cat to your machine and extract the files. 
* Go to Settings > Extensions in Google Chrome and enable Developer Mode
* Click "Load unpackaged extension..." and select the click2cat folder
* Go to a report page and enjoy the new feature!
